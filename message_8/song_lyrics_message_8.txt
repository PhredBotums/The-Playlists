1. Why Do We Shake In The Cold? - Edit - Elderbrook

Can't help the way the body moves
Why do we shake in the cold?
Naked and stoned
And how, that every time we choose
Something has to break in the fall
And I pay for it all
If only I could tell myself
At twenty years that someone else was
Waiting alone
Well I would've run
If only I could start again
I'd pick apart the pieces and
Assemble them all
The way that I want
Why do we shake in the cold?
Why do we shake in the cold?
Can't help the way the body moves
Why do we shake in the cold?
Naked and stoned
And how, that every time we choose
Something has to break in the fall
And I pay for it all
And I
Why do we shake in the cold?
(Why do we shake)
So, teach me how to swim
Before I learn to fly
Oh, I feel it on my skin
So hold me 'til I dry
Why do we shake in the cold?

Lies, deception and fantasy
Keep on floating in my memories
Hell is empty, about to freeze
Keep on dancing with my sanity
Lies, deception and fantasy

Toss and turning when I'm 'bout to sleep
I know I'm more than just a battery
All this acid inside of me

3. Strings Attached - Nu Aspect, Arkaden, Sam Welch

I, I see you found a pretty face
Is it porcelain?
Just like mine
I thought it would be easy
I thought I had the strength to keep my mind intact
But you're never easy
There's always strings attached
But now I'm barely breathing
'Cause you promised me heaven
But I'm already bleeding
From the strings attached (from the strings attached)
It ain't just secrets that you're keeping
'Cause you promised me heaven
But I'm already bleeding
From the strings attached (from the strings attached)
You, you got another figurine
Will you keep him locked up in your box of hearts?
I thought it would be easy
I thought I had the strength to keep my mind intact
But you're never easy
There's always strings attached
Ah, you promised me heaven
But you gave me nothing close
Yeah, you promised me heaven
But you gave me nothing close
But now I'm barely breathing
'Cause you promised me heaven
But I'm already bleeding
From the strings attached (from the strings attached)
It ain't just secrets that you're keeping
Maybe one day, I can forget the past
But I'm already bleeding (bleeding)
From the strings attached (from the strings attached)
Ah, you promised me heaven
But you gave me nothing close

5. I Feel Fine - Klangkarussell

I know you think you're saving the day for me
But you don't have to pray for me, pray for me
You know now, this ain't over, this ain't done
You know now, some of us have just begun
Ain't nobody waited so patiently
And even though the waves never break for me
You are the reason I been holdin' on
And I won't stop, dreamin' 'til the night is gone

[Chorus]
I feel fine, I feel fine
Yes, I do, yeah
Yes, it's true, yeah
I'm alright, I feel fine
Yes, I do, yeah
I got you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Baby, it's a gift how you lift me up
Maybe I forgive but I won't give up
I told you, this ain't over, this ain't done
I told you, you and me have just begun
We never surrender, remember that
So never forget that I got your back
The times when I was frozen, I was numb
But these days I can feel the risin' sun

[Chorus]
I feel fine, I feel fine
Yes, I do, yeah
Yes, it's true, yeah
I'm alright, I feel fine
Yes, I do, yeah
I got you, yeah

[Outro]
(Yeah, yeah)
I got you, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
I got you, yeah

6. Talking - Elderbrook

I got a friend but they don't like me
They don't like me like before
Could be the whiskey or the drinking
But I don't listen anymore
Oh, maybe we'll go out for breakfast
Or talk about it in our sleep
Oh, won't you tell me how your day is?
Oh, won't you tell me how you think?
When I'll do better, to talk about
Anything that you want now
But I should tell you, I love the sound
Of myself when I'm talking, of myself when I'm
Talking, talking, talking, talk
Of myself when I'm
Talking, talking, talking, talk
I got a friend way back in London
I try to visit when I can
It's like I'm always doing something
Whenever I'm in town
Well maybe I should bring her flowers
Or maybe I'll pick up a pen
And then I'll write her up a letter
And then I'll send it when I can
When I'll do better, to talk about
Anything that you want now
But I should tell you, I love the sound
Of myself when I'm talking, of myself when I'm
Talking, talking, talking, talk
Of myself when I'm
Talking, talking, talking, talk
Of myself when I'm
Talking, talking, talking, talk
Of myself when I'm
Talking, talking, talking, talk
Of myself when I'm
Talking, talking, talking, talk
Of myself when I'm
Talking, talking, talking, talk
Of myself when I'm
Talking, talking, talking, talk

7. Be Someone - CamelPhat, Jake Bugg

When you're dressing up
Still it's not enough
Who you tryna impress man
Needy for some love
Here to be someone
Tryna be someone
You're caught up in the past
I'll show you living fast
You're talking talking but ain't walking
I can't help but laugh
Here to be someone
Tryna be someone
Money and the cars
Don't make you a star
But all you got is talk and you're looking kinda lost
Here to be someone
Tryna be someone
Here to be someone
Tryna be someone
Here to be someone
(Be someone, be someone, be someone)
(Be someone, be someone, be someone, be someone)
Here to be someone

Needy for some love
Here to be someone

You're caught up in the past
I'll show you living fast
You're talking talking but ain't walking
I can't help but laugh
Here to be someone

8. Thin Line - John Summit, Guz

Everybody's looking for a meaning
Everybody's doing their own thing
And nobody's solving their problems
Ain't nobody helping each other
Some people give into fear
Some people give into hunger
Some of us live for the future
Hmm, and some of us wonder
Give a little light, give a little love
Maybe there's enough for everyone
Give a little hope and a little drugs
Maybe there's enough for everyone
We're all dancing on a, dancing on a thin line
We're all dancing on a, dancing on a thin line
We're all dancing on a, dancing on a thin line
We're all dancing on a, they're making a way
We're all dancing on a, dancing on a thin line
We're all dancing on a, dancing on a thin line
We're all dancing on a, dancing on a thin line
We're all dancing on a, but they're making a way
But they're making a way
Everbody's getting frustrated
Why should we live with this hatred?
We're all dancing on a thin line
But they're making a way, having a good time
So who's gonna give us the answer? (Sister and brother)
Give a little light, give a little love
Maybe there's enough for everyone
(People hold on)
Ooh-ooh (don't do yourself wrong)
We're all dancing on a, dancing on a thin line
We're all dancing on a, dancing on a thin line
We're all dancing on a, dancing on a thin line
We're all dancing on a, having a good time
We're all dancing on a, dancing on a thin line
We're all dancing on a, dancing on a thin line
We're all dancing on a, dancing on a thin line
We're all dancing on a, they're making a way
We're all dancing on a, dancing on a thin line
We're all dancing on a, dancing on a thin line
We're all dancing on a, dancing on a thin line
We're all dancing on a, having a good time
Give a little light, give a little love
Maybe there's enough for everyone
Give a little hope and a little drugs
Maybe there's enough for everyone

9. Stir Me Up - Ryan Murgatroyd Remix - Lane 8, Ryan Murgatroyd

Waves that are still are
Brought into motion
Time that we spent
And foolishly cautioned
Sip on this water,
Taste from this heartbeat
And stir me up darling

Even when we're lost
We find a way to our glory
Hey hey oh oh oh
Hey hey oh oh oh

Steady we're holding up as two
And all of our days are made new
Sing to the valley, run to the river
And stir me up darling

Even when we're lost
We find a way to our glory
Even at all cost
We find a way to our glory
Hey hey oh oh oh
Hey hey oh oh oh

Even when we're lost
We find a way to our glory
Even at all cost
We find a way to our glory
Hey hey oh oh oh
Hey hey oh oh oh

10. Young - Vallis Alps

Look back
To when midnights broke their sleep
Awake in our memories
Of when we would make-believe
Collide
Colors of the masquerade
Watch as they fall away
Faceless under faces made
And weeks went by but felt like hours
Spring would lie in summer showers
In my hair were winter flowers
And weeks went by but felt like hours
Seasons multiplying powers
That I found in winter flowers
Turn back
I see rivers beyond the line
Ancient roads in broken design
Angels running through our minds
Look up
Your city's built on marble floors
Neon lights in the falling snow
Those night back in Tokyo
And weeks went by but felt like hours
Spring would lie in summer showers
In my hair were winter flowers
And weeks went by but felt like hours
Seasons multiplying powers
That I found in winter flowers
And we said
This has only just begun
In the end
Time forever favors the young
And we said
This has only just begun
In the end
Time forever favors the young

11. Something New - Noctilucent

Open your eyes and make your entrance
Your first step into this world
And take my hand, I will embrace you
Know you'll never be alone

Open your eyes and see the splendor
Of all the beauty all around
Step by step you'll reach the summit
And I will help you on your road

12. Born To Love (feat. SHELLS) - MEDUZA, SHELLS

I was born to love
To feel that touch
I was born to love
Fill up my heart

To feel that touch
Give the whole of my heart

14. Feel the Way I Do (Northeast Party House Remix) - The Jungle Giants

I'm coming in, out to shake your hand
'Cause baby, we get off, get off, get off
It could be a real love, it's true
Oh, and everyone around don't seem that real now

I know you feel the way I do
'Cause there ain't nobody else like us out here
And there ain't nothing you can do
But feel the way I feel too

That could be it running through my head
'Cause baby, I haven't seen it like this before
It could be a real love, it's true
Oh, and everything around don’t seem that big now

I know you feel the way I do
'Cause there ain't nobody else like us out here
And there ain't nothing you can do
But feel the way I feel too
