1. Be With You - RÜFÜS DU SOL

Yeah!
I could feel it
When I heard you're coming home
I've been waiting for your call to come
I remember, and it feels like yesterday
Haven't seen you for years, oh
Now you're home, and I'll be with you
Be with you, I'll be with you
I'll be with you, I will be
I'll be with you, I'll be with you

I'll be with you, I'll be with you
I'll be with you, I will be (I'll be with you)
If you're leaving
Then I know it's not for long
So I listen
To all your desires
In the moonlight, we could dance into the night
Let the world disappear, oh
'Cause now we're here and I'll be with you
Be with you, I'll be with you
I'll be with you, I will be
I'll be with you, I'll be with you

2. Alone Together - Astrality, Georgia Blackwell

All at once, all I need
Moment in your company
Take me home where we can be
Alone together
Put me in a picture frame
Hang it on the wall, I say
Remember me when we're far away
Keep me close 'til I'm here again
Here again, here again
Remember me when we're far away
Keep me close 'til I'm here again
Here again, here again (here again)
All at once, all I need
Moment in your company
Take me home where we can be
Alone together
Put me in a picture frame
Hang it on the wall, I say
Remember me when we're far away
Keep me close 'til I'm here again
Here again, here again
Remember me when we're far away
Keep me close 'til I'm here again
Here again, here again (here again)
Alone together

3. Stuck In The Middle - Greentea Peng

Stuck in the middle
I have been pushed, I have been pulled
There is no leading me, no more astray
I have been pushed, I have been pulled
There is no need
I walk these streets amongst lost souls
I know there is no space for doubt no more
It's all written, that's how it goes
No point in resisting the flow
Getting your energy low
Worrying about things that you can't control
Had to dip out and into my zone (zone, zone)
Listen closely, what's that sound
Rising up from the underground?
Their heads ain't lost, but it ain't been found
Ain't in the habit of sticking around
Ain't in the habit of sticking around
Stuck in the middle
I have been pushed and I've been pulled
There is no fooling me no more, no way
I have been pushed and I've been pulled
You have no say no more
I walk these lands with open mind and eyes
I find the more conclusions, the more I just feel confined
No more wasting time on your negative vibes
Tryna stay in line
I'm tryna stay in line (stay in line, stay in line, stay in line)
Listen closely, what's that sound (ooh, yeah)
Rising up from the underground? (ooh, yeah)
Their heads ain't lost, but it ain't been found (ooh, yeah)
Ain't in the habit of sticking around
Ain't in the habit of sticking around
Listen closely, what's that sound (ooh, yeah)
Rising up from the underground? (ooh, yeah)
Their heads ain't lost, but it ain't been found (ooh, yeah)
Ain't in the habit of sticking around
Ain't in the habit of sticking around, oh no, no
I have been pushed, I have been
I have been pushed, I have been
I have been, I have been
I have been pushed, I have been pulled
I have been
I have been pushed, I have been
Tryna stay in line

4. Finally - Swedish House Mafia, Alicia Keys

Time marches on, never-ending
Time keeps its own time
Here we stand at beginning
And in those passin' us by
And I, I, I can dream for us all
Now I won't make the same mistakes
Time and time again

[Build]

And no more tears to cry
And mornin', mornin'
Mornin' won't ever be the samе
Now I won't make the same mistakеs
Time and time again

5. Giant (with Rag'n'Bone Man) - Calvin Harris, Rag'n'Bone Man

I understood loneliness before I knew what it was
I saw the pills on the table for your unrequited love
Well, I would be nothing without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant (ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see

We'll be breaking boulders, underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (oh)

Togetherness, togetherness, togetherness

6. Believe In Myself - PARISI

When all of my dreams were dust on a shelf
You made me believe in myself
And all of my dreams were dust on a shelf
You made me believe in myself (believe in myself)
I lost so much faith
And nothing would help
You made me believe in myself
You made me
You made me believe in myself
You made me
You made me
You made me believe in myself
You made me
You made me believe in myself
You made me
You made me believe in myself
You made me
You made me
You made me believe in myself
When I couldn't find a reason
And the light inside of me was growing faint
You saw me
And you made me myself again
And you made me myself again
(Made me myself again)
(You made me myself again)
(You made me)
(You made me myself again)
(You made me myself again) you made me believe in myself
you made me believe in myself

9. No Ending - Nils Hoffmann Remix - Yotto, Julia Church, Nils Hoffmann

22, the number of your first house
That I drove past this evening
Started wondering how you've been
Losing you was like losing the last page
Of the book I've been reading
I don't know how this one ends

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's alright, 'cause it keeps me dreaming when I lose my fight

[Chorus]
Does it keep you up?
Sometimes I think it must
No ending to write just yet
But maybe that's all we'll get
Are you still the same, have we've gone different ways?
No ending to write just yеt
But maybe that's all that we'll get

[Verse 2]
Thеre were signs, I always miss the exit
But I quite like the long way
See the things I usually don't
I'll be fine 'cause every single morning
There's a new kind of caution
Take it everywhere I go

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's alright, 'cause it keeps me dreaming when I lose my fight

[Chorus]
Does it keep you up?
Sometimes I think it must
No ending to write just yet
But maybe that's all we'll get
Are you still the same, have we've gone different ways?
No ending to write just yet
But maybe that's all that we'll get
Does it keep you up?
Sometimes I think it must
No ending to write just yet
But maybe that's all we'll get
Are you still the same, have we've gone different ways?
No ending to write just yet
But maybe that's all that we'll get

10. Enough to Believe - Jamie Jones Remix - Bob Moses, Jamie Jones

Holding my hand
Hoping I can make it to the end
I wasn't looking for a phantom or a friend
Tryna find an answer in the wind
I keep feeling like I'm rushing to the end
Looking for a good place to begin
But will I ever know? I'll never know...

Holding my hand
Hoping I can make it to the end
I wasn't looking for a phantom or a friend
Tryna find an answer in the wind
I keep feeling like I'm...

Wondering where to begin
Loneliness rises again
All I knew isn't right for me now
Oh, I'm wondering where to begin...

Holding my hand
Hoping I can make it to the end
I wasn't looking for a phantom or a friend
Tryna find an answer in the wind
I keep feeling like I'm...

Don't wait, you can push to start
Lose control
Kill me slowly with your kiss
Wrap me 'round your fingertips
Damn, I need another hit
Make me lose my mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losin' my m-m-m-mind, m-m-m-mind
M-m-m-mind, m-m-m-mind

12. Inner Light - Elderbrook, Bob Moses

Standing tired
On your feet
Lightest head
Just like me
You wanna dance
I wanna lead
A sleight of the hand
That you never see
You wanna dance
You don't know how to get it on the floor
Then don't hold back for anyone
Close your eyes, just follow the inner light
You count on me
You count on me
You count on me
I can fly
I can breathe
And learn to sing
Like do-re-mi
So you wanna dance
And you wanna be
A bat out of hell
Follow my lead
You wanna dance
You don't know how to get it on the floor
Then don't hold back for anyone
Close your eyes, just follow the inner light
(You count on me)
You wanna dance
You don't know how to get it on the floor
Then don't hold back for anyone
Close your eyes, just follow the inner light
(You count on me)
So follow
Me to
Our old life
Falling
Deeper
Into the light
Into the light
You wanna dance
I wanna lead
A sleight of the hand
That you never see
You wanna dance
You don't know how to get it on the floor
Then don't hold back for anyone
Close your eyes just for the inner light
You count on me
You wanna dance
You don't know how to get it on the floor
Then don't hold back for anyone
Close your eyes just for the inner light
You count on me
You count on me
You count on me
