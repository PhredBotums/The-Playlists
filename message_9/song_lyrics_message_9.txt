1. Goosebumps - Astrality

This moment in time
A break in the dive
Hang in the air for a breath I'm alive
My skin is electric
You feed into me
Oh I don't know where to go can you lead
I get goosebumps
When you say my name
They're taking over me
I get goosebumps
Hit me like a wave
You pull me underneath
I won't lose myself to you
I won't lose myself to you
And with all of the silent nights that I've been through
I won't lose myself to you
Break into shivers
Words turning cold
Clinging to pieces of me
Left to hold
Stolen my gaze
Oh my eyes they have fallen down
I can't stay so I'll run leave you shouting out
I get goosebumps
When you say my name
They're taking over me
I get goosebumps
Hit me like a wave
You pull me underneath
I won't lose myself to you
I won't lose myself to you
And with all of the silent nights that I've been through
I won't lose myself to you

2. Lost - RSCL, it's murph, Twin Diplomacy, Jack August  

I'm fallin' out of focus
'Cause I get lost
Holdin' on
To it all, all, all, all
'Cause I get lost
Holdin' on
To it all
Oh, I guess I'm lookin' at your flaws
You gon' make me act up
Oh, I guess I'm lookin' at your flaws
You gon' make me act up
I'm fallin' out of focus, yeah
'Cause I get lost
Holdin' on
To it all, all, all, all

3. Lights On - Marshmello, FAANGS  

Your hold won't let me be
They say that love will set you free
At least that's what they told you
And if I have no self-control
At least I have my composure
Guarding the back, be beside you, a soldier
Your world on my shoulders
I'd do it all again, I'd do it all over
Turn the lights on
I wanna see the good, I wanna see the bad
Turn the lights on
All these imperfections will be real, yeah
Turn the lights on
Lights on, lights on, lights on, lights on
Lights on, lights on, lights on
Turn the lights on
Lights on, lights on, lights on
Lights on, lights on, lights on
Show me what I can't see
And if I can't push you away, baby, I'll pull you closer
The clarity I found in you
Now it's overexposure
The scars that we open, the hearts that we've broken
No, we don't need closure
I'd do it all again, I'd do it all over
Turn the lights on
I wanna see the good, I wanna see the bad
Turn the lights on
All these imperfections will be real, yeah
Turn the lights on
Lights on, lights on, lights on, lights on
Lights on, lights on, lights on
Turn the lights on
Lights on, lights on, lights on
Lights on, lights on, lights on
Turn the lights on

Took a train through Shanghai,
Came around just to say hi
Met a girl she was 6′5,
soft spoken with red eyes
She made me realize
It was time to cut ties
It was time to cut ties, ooh.
She made me realize that

They say I play too much
You can take this heart
I'm always on a run.

10. We Are The People - southstar Remix - Empire Of The Sun, southstar  

We can remember, swimming in December
Heading for the city lights, in 1975
We share in each other, nearer than farther
The scent of a lemon drips from your eyes

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world, take me now, we can try
We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world, take me now, we can try

We share in each other, the feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven, got lost in your eyes

Can't do well, when I think you're gonna leave me, but I'm gonna try
Are you gonna leave me now? Can't you be believing now?
Can't do well, when I think you're gonna leave me, but I'm gonna try
Are you gonna leave me now? Can't you be believing now?

Can you remember and humanize?
It was still where we'd energized
Lie in the sand and visualize, like it's '75 again
We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world, take me now, we can try

Can't do well, when I think you're gonna leave me, but I'm gonna try
Are you gonna leave me now? Can't you be believing now?
Can't do well, when I think you're gonna leave me, but I'm gonna try
Are you gonna leave me now? Can't you be believing now?

I know everything about you
You know everything about me
We know everything about us
I know everything about you
You know everything about me
We know everything about us

Can't do well, when I think you're gonna leave me, but I'm gonna try
Are you gonna leave me now? Can't you be believing now?
I can't do well, when I think you're gonna leave me, but I'm gonna try
Are you gonna leave me now? Can't you be believing now?

Ya, boum!
Mezclados, somos mezclados
La misma historia con otro sabor
Venimos de todos lados
Con baile, ritmo y mucho color
Entonces baila conmigo
Que esta mezcla rompa el hielo y rompa el brillo
Mezclados de todos lados
Cambiando somos piel y corazón
Sí, somos la sangre que corre en las venas
Sí, es el sentir de mi raíz, so
Yo soy un colombiano
Yo soy americano
Yo soy un ciudadano del mundo
Yo soy un mexicano
Yo soy dominicano
De la misma raza, el mismo color
¡Baila, baila!

Yo soy un ciudadano del mundo
Yo soy un mexicano
Yo soy dominicano
De la misma raza, el mismo color
Somos los originales
Súper internacionales
Escuchamos tus consejos y aprendemos tus modales
Y aunque somos diferentes, a la vez somos iguales
En la misma situación en distintos lugares
Somos internacionales
Sin importar cuántos ni cuáles
Somos los originales
Somos internacionales
Sí, somos la sangre que corre en las venas
Sí, es el sentir de mi raíz, so
Yo soy un colombiano
Yo soy americano
Yo soy un ciudadano del mundo
Yo soy un mexicano

¡Hey! Todo el mundo
Es que lo siento así, volver a la raíz
Yo pertenezco aquí
(En el mismo lugar, en el mismo lugar)
Yo pertenezco aquí
(En el mismo lugar, en el mismo lugar)
Sí, somos la sangre que corre en las venas
Sí, es el sentir de mi raíz, so

12. Aguila ft. Cumbiafrica - HUGEL, Westend, Cumbiafrica  

Águila del monte, del monte será
Se le oyen las voces, como el pavo real
Se le oyen las voces, como el pavo real
Águila del monte, del monte será
Se le oyen las voces, como el pavo real
Se le oyen las voces, como el pavo real
Cada vez que voy al mar
Se me presentan mis penas
Y al ver la profundidad
Donde mi amante navega
Águila del monte, del monte será
Se le oyen las voces, como el pavo real
Se pusieron a cantar
A las cinco 'e la mañana
El pajuil y el pavo real
El clarín de las montañas
Águila del monte, del monte será
Se le oyen las voces, como el pavo real
Pavo real
Pavo real
Pavo real
Cada vez que voy al mar
Se me presentan mis penas
Y al ver la profundidad
Donde mi amante navega
Águila del monte, del monte será
Se le oyen las voces, como el pavo real
Calandra, que vas volando
Recorriendo to' el espacio
Con tu pico recogiendo el rocío nacarado
Águila del monte, del monte será
Se le oyen las voces, como el pavo real
Real, real, real, real
Real, real, real, real
Real, real, real, real
Real, real
El clarín del las montañas
Águila del monte, del monte será
Se le oyen las voces, como el pavo real (sí)
Águila del monte, del monte será
Se le oyen las voces, como el pavo real
Calandra que tanto cantas
Que remedas un jilguero
Dime, ¿por cuánto le cantas?
A mí y a mis compañeros
Águila del monte, del monte será
Se le oyen las voces, como el pavo real
Pavo real
Pavo real
Pavo real
Pavo real

13. One More (feat. Nile Rodgers) - SG Lewis, Nile Rodgers  

I know you can't stay here forever
I know you've got friends in the bathroom stall
Been wanna do this since I met you
Can we just stay here for (one)
You'll just get distracted and see someone you know
I'll be waiting getting impatient all alone
Go out on the balcony, light myself a smoke
Start talking to someone that I don't even know
They just might invite me to see another spot
You'll be tryna find me again but I'll be gone
We'll forget each other, the night will carry on
But that don't have to happen
And that's not what I want, 'cause
I know you can't stay here forever
I know you've got friends in the bathroom stall
Been wanna do this since I met you
Can we just stay here for one more song
If you leave now I might forget you
The memory fades when I'm way too gone
Was hoping we'd wake up together
Maybe just stay here for one more song
Maybe just stay here for one more song
Now imagine that you stay and we just keep it going
Just another couple minutes in the vibe we're on
Then I'll come with you where you're going and we'll both take one
Feeling rushing over both of us
So we'll go out on the balcony
Light ourselves a smoke
Start talking to people that we don't even know
Maybe call a taxi, to hit another spot
But this time you'll be with me, and yeah that's what I want, 'cause
I know you can't stay here forever
I know you've got friends in the bathroom stall
Been wanna do this since I met you
Can we just stay here for one more song
If you leave now might forget you
The memory fades when I'm way too gone
Was hoping we'd wake up together
Maybe just stay here for one more song
I know you can't stay here forever
Maybe just stay here for one more song

14. Moon Tattoo - Sofi Tukker  

Moon if I don't follow you, follow you
That may be much pure
Moon if I don't bother you
That may be more mature
But Moon I wanna show you off
I wanna dress in you
And then I wanna take you off
And show my moon tattoo
Moon I wanna paint you on
Moon I wanna show you off
Moon I wanna show you too
My process in my prayer
Moon I wanna dress in you
Moon I wanna see you blue
Moon I wanna show you how
How I resist your stare

The gentle silhouette
Moon I'll catch you on a game
You talked me in before we met
You talked me in before we met
You talked me in before we met
You talked me in before we met
